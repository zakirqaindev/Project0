# Project0
##Project 01: Homepage
##Objectives

###Learn to use SCSS to write more complex stylesheets for your webpages.
##Getting Started
###Your First Webpage


Then, in a terminal window (located in /Applications/Utilities on Mac or by typing cmd in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted project0 (recall that the cd command can change your current directory), and run

cd project0
to enter the project directory. Now, run

touch index.html
to create a new index.html file in your repository. Open the file with your favorite text editor: popular choices include Atom, Sublime Text, and VS Code. Then, paste in the following contents:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, world!
    </body>
</html>
Then, save your index.html file.

Requirements
Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:

Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in Lecture 0, some will be introduced in Lecture 1.
